# PyBookmanager
Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on Python and SQL (sqlite3) that allows to manage a database of books and perfom operations such as view, add, delete and update books

There are two ways of running the app:

1. By opening the .exe file (not need to have installaed python or text editor in yout computer)
2. By opening fronted.py and backed.py in the command line.

I have added my personal database (books.db) if you want to use instead of starting from scratch
